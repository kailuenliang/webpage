               <p> Interview with Franco 'Bifo' Beradi </p>
              <p> You see, you and I are not rewired. We have been wired by our body relation with the mother, human beings speaking a language which is the language of ambiguity — the language of mutual understanding. </p> <p>This is not about us, it’s about the connected generation. I think that the connected generation is increasingly entering a dimension where the possibility of deep conjunctive understanding is over because the connective generation is affectively deprived, affectively depleted, because the presence of the mother is almost ‘dissolving’. Not only the physical presence of the mother but the mental presence of the mother, because the precarious worker, the cognitive worker and particularly the feminine precarious worker is totally absorbed. Twenty-four hours a day, even when sleeping, one is absorbed by the social investment of affective and intellectual energies. So the presence of the mother is sort of dissolving, disappearing, and is increasingly replaced by the presence of the screen, by the presence of the connective tools. Well, yes, I think that there is a philosophical problem in it, which is concerning the concept of post-human. Can we really speak of post-human? I am not sure because the concept of human is so impossible to define, that I cannot say beyond the human. It is human, everything is human. But it is post-conjunctive. Post in the sense of, a form of communication in which the human ambiguity is lost, and if you lose ambiguity you lose everything.</p>
